Simulate a fresh install on a brand new computer anytime using a virtual
machine.

Check if your processor has virtualization support for KVM.

  $ lscpu | grep Virtualization

Install package "qemu" using your installer. TODO: on some systems you
may need to be more specific. Test and document.

Create a virtual disk drive for the VM. Use the "qcow2" format so it
will not take up space unnecessarily. 10G of space is often enough but
make the disk space bigger if needed.

  $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 centos7.img 10G

Boot up a VM configured to boot from the installation media. Be sure to
enable-kvm so it runs smoothly, and give it a reasonable amount of RAM
like 2 GB.

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom \
    ~/Downloads/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-2009/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-2009.iso \
    -boot order=d -drive file=centos7.img,format=qcow2 -m 2G -enable-kvm

Complete the installation process like normal, then you can reboot or
poweroff the virtual machine. Boot your newly installed system. The
VM is called a "guest" while your actual computer is called the "host".

  $ qemu-system-x85_64 -drive file=centos7.img,format=qcow2 -m 2G \
    -enable-kvm

QEMU automatically provides a wired network connection for the guest to
use whatever network connection your host machine has. I had to
configure CentOS to use the network by using the following command.

  $ dhclient

To connect to servers running on the guest machine, you need to forward
unused ports to the guest. The following command launches the machine as
above but with special ports forwarded to it for SSH and HTTP access.

  $ qemu-system-x85_64 -drive file=centos7.img,format=qcow2 -m 2G \
    -enable-kvm -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::18080-:8080

You can now connect by going to http://localhost:18080 or use SSH as
follows.

  $ ssh -p 10022 127.0.0.1
