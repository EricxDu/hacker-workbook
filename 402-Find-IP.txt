You can find devices on your subnet by the IP address they are listening
on. This is useful if you connect to another computer via ethernet
cable. Use one of the following commands to find your own IP first.

  $ ifconfig
  $ hostname -I

Your IP address on the local area network will usually starts with
192.168. Your IP address on an ethernet connection direct with another
computer usually starts with 10.42. You can scan for other devices on
the network you're looking for.

  $ nmap -sn 10.42.0.0/24

You can sus out the computer you're looking for using the results of the
command. The usually command exits after only a few seconds, so if it
takes very long you may have another issue.

Now you can connect to the remote computer.

  $ ssh me@10.42.0.128
